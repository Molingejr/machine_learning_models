# Machine Learning Models
Here we focus on utilizing machine learning models to make predictions and find patterns within data.

We apply the Data Science of
1. Setting the research goal
2. Retrieving data
3. Data preparation
4. Data exploration
5. Data modeling
6. Presentation

There are many machine learning models out there and we will look at as much as we can. Focusing on all genre of machine learning like `Supervised`, `Unsupervised`, and `Semi-supervised`.
